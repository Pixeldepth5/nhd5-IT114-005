FONTS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

To use the custom fonts "Behind the Nineties" and "Visby CF":

1. Place your font files in this "fonts" folder:
   - Behind the Nineties: Any .ttf or .otf file containing "nineties" or "behind" in the filename
   - Visby CF: Any .ttf or .otf file containing "visby" in the filename

2. Supported formats: .ttf (TrueType) and .otf (OpenType)

3. The application will automatically:
   - First try to find fonts installed on your system
   - Then try to load from this fonts folder
   - Fall back to standard system fonts if not found

4. Font usage:
   - "Behind the Nineties" is used for the main title (36pt)
   - "Visby CF" is used for all subtitles, labels, and buttons (16pt)

Example filenames that will work:
- BehindTheNineties.ttf
- behind-the-nineties.otf
- VisbyCF-Regular.ttf
- visby-cf.otf

The game will run fine even without these fonts - it will use system fallback fonts.
